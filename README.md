# CSE-BUBBLE
This repository contains the course project of CS220A. We have made an Instruction Set Architecture with 25 Instructions using the verilog hardware description language, and implemented 'Bubble Sort' using the same.

Run the command - 
```bash
iverilog -o test CSE_BUBBLE_tb.v vvp test
```


Note: The instructions have been stores in the 'fetch_instructions.v', and the data has been stored in 'fetch_data.v'
